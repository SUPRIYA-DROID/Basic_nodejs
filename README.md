### N.SUPRIYA
# TOPIC : GIT COMMANDS
*In we learnt about different types of git commands and how to use it.*
** First we created a folder in the desktop and then opened it in the vs code and then we had to open the integrated terminal.  Now to create the node js we have to keep the node js we should use the command --> npm init -y
Now the package.json file appears. After this we should create the folder called server.js and we should write the command npm install and in the server.js write console.log("hello, this is subbu") something like this.  Now to visualize this we should write this command called node server.js.
Express is one of the dependencies to install this. We should use the command called --> npm install express dotenv.  Now we need to use the command called --> git init and create a file called .gitignore.  .gitignore is a file where we store some secure passwords or something important that won't be shown in the git publicly. It is safe. To store any file in this we should write the name of the file for example: node_modules/ we should add the / symbol.  And I also learned some important commands and things. **
1. We should press ctrl c to exit or stop the code from running in the terminal.
2. cd means change directory
3. cd.. to move forward
4. To duplicate our file we should use the command--> git clone <url>
5.  git init command is used to initialize a new git repository
6.  git add. is used to make changes which are written , if we use this everything changes if you want to change only a single file we should use the name of the file instead of (.)
7. git commit is used to save changes to our local repository. We should use the command --> git commit -m" "

* Now we should create a new repository with the name of our project and we should copy the link of our github repository. 
* Now to connect our local repository to our git repository we should use the command -->git remote add origin (link). 
* Now we should push for that first we need to know in which branch we are so that we need to use the command--> git branch and press enter now we will know in which branch we are so now we should use the the command --> git push origin( branch name)  now it's done now if we can see the files now we can see the three files that we created  .gitignore, server.js, package.json but for me i even got the package-lock json i should rectify that error.
# CONCLUSION:
  In the conclusion I learned what are git commands and how to work with Git commands. i did a project on node js, i installed dependencies like express and dotenv, and created files such as server.js , .gitignore. I learned about how to use local repository. I practiced some important Git commands like git commit, git add .,git branch, git push, git clone.
  I learned something very important today and understood and practiced it
